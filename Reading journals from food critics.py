# # Lesson 3: Reading journals from food critics
# 
# In this lesson, you'll use AI to decide whether the contents of a file are about food and restaurants.
# 
# Text data like emails, journal entries, and social media posts often have no predefined structure. Additionally, each person writes in their own style: some use bullet points, while others prefer long paragraphs. For this reason, text data is known as **unstructured data**. 

# Let's start by loading some helper functions to use in the notebook:

# In[1]:


from helper_functions import get_llm_response, print_llm_response


# ## Working with text data

# You'll take look at journal entries in the working directory. The journals are stored as plain text files with extension `.txt'.
# 
# Start by opening and reading the Cape Town journal:

# In[2]:


f = open("cape_town.txt", "r")
journal_cape_town = f.read()
f.close()


# Print the contents of the journal:

# In[3]:


print(journal_cape_town)


# As you can see, the file is about restaurants and food.
# 
# Next, open the Tokyo journal entry file and read its contents:

# In[4]:


f = open("tokyo.txt", "r")
journal_tokyo = f.read() 
f.close()


# Print the contents of the journal:

# In[5]:


print(journal_tokyo)


# This entry is also about restaurants and food - but notice how different the format of the journal is from the Cape Town example!

# ## Determining if text files are relevant using LLMs

# In this section, you'll write a prompt that instructs an LLM to determine whether a file content is about food and restaurants or some other topic. 
# 
# Define the prompt and include the Tokyo journal entry as the input data to check:

# In[6]:


prompt = f"""Respond with "Relevant" or "Not relevant": 
the journal describes restaurants and their specialties. 

Journal:
{journal_tokyo}"""


# Print the LLM response to see if the file is relevant for our purpose or not:

# In[7]:


print_llm_response(prompt)


# ## Checking all files using a `for` loop

# Using Python and an LLM together allows you to quickly iterate over multiple files and check the relevance of the content for your tasks.
# 
# Start by creating a list of all the files you want to check:

# In[8]:


# List of the journal files
files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]


# Next, use a `for` loop to open each file and have an LLM check if the content from that file is relevant to food and restaurants.
# * *If you need a refresher on `for` loops, please revisit Course 2!*

# In[ ]:


for file in files:
    # Read journal file for the city
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()

    # Create prompt
    prompt = f"""Respond with "Relevant" or "Not relevant": 
    the journal describes restaurants and their specialties. 

    Journal:
    {journal}"""

    # Use LLM to determine if the journal entry is useful
    #print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")
    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")


# It seems that the Madrid journal entry is not relevant. Let's print its contents to see why the LLM flagged it as "not relevant":

# In[10]:


# Here you can check the content from any journal entry
f = open("madrid.txt", "r") 
print(f.read()) 
f.close()


# The Madrid journal entry doesn't contain information about restaurants to try. Instead, it is a description of the economy of the city.

#     I am using AI to determine whether different texts are "relevant" or "not relevant" using an LLM. Does this task have a specific name in AI?
# </p>

# ## Extra practice
# 
# Experiment with different prompts to check whether files are of interest to you or not. Below is the example suggested in the video - try running it first. Then, try each exercise.
# 
# ### Exercise 1
# 
# Change the prompt to classify the text for different topics, for example "mentions a dessert" or "describes the restaurant design."

# In[29]:


files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", 
         "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]

for file in files:
    # Read journal file for the city
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()

    # TRY CHANGING THIS PROMPT TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
    prompt = f"""Respond with "mention a dessert" or "describes the restaurant design": 
    the journal describes restaurants and food dishes. 

    Journal:
    {journal}"""

    # Use LLM to determine if the journal entry is useful
    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")


# ### Exercise 2
# 
# Using the same code below, change the prompt to classify into more than two categories.
# 
# **Example:**
# - mentions a **vegetarian** dish
# - mentions a **vegan** dish
# - mentions both
# - mentions neither

# In[26]:


files = ["cape_town.txt", "madrid.txt", "rio_de_janeiro.txt", 
         "sydney.txt", "tokyo.txt"]

for file in files:
    # Read journal file for the city
    f = open(file, "r")
    journal = f.read()
    f.close()

    # TRY CHANGING THIS PROMPT TO ASK DIFFERENT QUESTIONS
    prompt = f"""Respond with "restuant name" and a dish category as "vegetarian" or "vegan": 
    the journal describes restaurants and food dishes.
    

    Journal:
    {journal}"""

    # Use LLM to determine if the journal entry is useful
    print(f"{file} -> {get_llm_response(prompt)}")
